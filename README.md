# AOC 2015 - 2021 
This is where I store some of my more interesting solutions to Advent of Code Puzzles released  prior to 2022.
I have solved all of these using R but I would like to test out Python in the future, some problems are more suited for R and some are more suited 
for other languages. An example of this is anything involving tree structures and circular linked lists, those kind of questions are not always so easy to solve in R. 
Email me at zstekler@asu.edu if you have any suggestions.
